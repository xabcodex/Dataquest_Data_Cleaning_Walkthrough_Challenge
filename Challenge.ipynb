    "At Dataquest, we're huge believers in learning through doing, and we hope this shows in your experience with the missions. While missions focus on introducing concepts, challenges allow you to perform deliberate practice by completing structured problems. You can read more about deliberate practice [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_(learning_method)#Deliberate_practice) and [at Nautilus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_(learning_method)#Deliberate_practice). Challenges will feel similar to missions, but with little instructional material and a larger focus on exercises.\n",

Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to clean up their data set so it can be more useful for analysis in pandas. Let's read it into pandas as a dataframe and preview the first five rows to get a better sense of it."
